# 3D Reconstruction with Computer Vision

This project uses computer vision techniques to create a 3D model of an object from images.  
The approach is based on triangulation and camera calibration. Given multiple images of an object,  
the program calculates depth information and reconstructs the 3D structure.

## Files
- `final.ipynb` â€“ Jupyter Notebook containing the implementation and steps
- Calibration images and object images 

## Purpose
This project demonstrates how multiple 2D images can be combined with calibration data  
to build a 3D model, a common technique in computer vision and graphics.
